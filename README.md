# 🛍️ Customer Segmentation using K-Means Clustering

This project applies **K-Means clustering** on a mall customers dataset to segment customers based on **annual income** and **spending score**.  
It helps businesses understand customer behavior and target marketing campaigns more effectively.  

## 📌 Features
- Data preprocessing and visualization (Matplotlib, Seaborn, Pandas).
- Optimal cluster selection using the **Elbow Method**.
- Applied **K-Means clustering** to group customers.
- Visualized customer segments with clear scatter plots.

## 📂 Tech Stack
- **Python**
- **Scikit-learn**
- **Pandas / NumPy**
- **Matplotlib / Seaborn**

## 📊 Results
- Identified distinct customer groups such as *high spenders, low spenders, average customers, and potential targets*.
- Provided visual insights that businesses can use for **personalized marketing**.

## 🔹 Insights
- Customers were grouped into **4–5 meaningful clusters**:
  - **High income, high spenders** → Premium customers.  
  - **High income, low spenders** → Potential customers for upselling.  
  - **Low income, high spenders** → Impulsive buyers.  
  - **Low income, low spenders** → Budget-conscious customers.  

- These insights can help businesses with:  
  - Targeted marketing campaigns.  
  - Customer retention strategies.
